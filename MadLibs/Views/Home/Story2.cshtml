    <h1>A fantastical adventure</h1>
    <p>
      Today I went to the zoo. I saw a/an @Model.Adjective1 @Model.Noun1 jumping up and down in its tree. He @Model.PtVerb1 @Model.Adverb1 through the large tunnel that led to its @Model.Adjective2 @Model.Noun2. I got some peanuts and passed them through the cage to a gigantic gray @Model.Noun3, towering above my head. Feeding that animal made me hungry. I went to get a @Model.Adjective3 scoop of ice cream. It filled my stomach. Afterwards I had t0 @Model.Verb1 @Model.Adverb2 to catch our bus.When I got home I @Model.PtVerb2 my mom for a @Model.Adjective4 day at the zoo.
