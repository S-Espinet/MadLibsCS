    <h1>A fantastical adventure</h1>
    <p>
      One day, @Model.Person1 and @Model.Person2 were walking through the woods, when suddenly a giant @Model.Animal appeared. "@Model.Exclamation", @Model.Person1 cried. The two of them @Model.Verb as quickly possible, and when they were safe, @Model.Person1 and @Model.Person2 gave each other a giant @Model.Noun.
